“Maintain at or below 3000”.
2) Requests higher than 3000 will be issued:  
“Maintain 3000, expect higher with departure”

## Ground Control
### General
- GC is responsible for all movement areas on the airport except the runways, the
northwest helipad, and the portion of the National Guard Taxiway designated as
a movement area.
- GC may be authorized to assume the responsibilities of the non-advertised
inactive runway by Local (this is a required item in the pre-position controller
briefing)
- GC will use the intersection departure distances in FIG. 4-1 for any aircraft that
requests/or is willing to perform an intersection departure and shall be advised
prior to taxi. ![](FIG_4_1.png)
### Taxiway Routes and Restrictions
- GC must protect the intersection of taxiways C and E for all aircraft that may use
these movement areas to exit active runways.
- GC may issue multiple runway crossing clearances in a single clearance for
aircraft operating on Taxiway Kilo.

    - E/W combined. May use simplified BUF_APP callsign
    - X may be combined when the position is not separately staffed by
another controller IAW 6.6.
2) ERI_APP
    - Other positions may only be opened during events or with the permission of the
ATM/DATM/TA/EC/CIC.

## Issue Clearances / Amendments / Instructions
CD shall issue ATC clearances to IFR and VFR Class C departures as followed:
- IFR Departures: Assign 10,000ft or requested altitude if lower, and inform the
aircraft to expect (requested altitude) 10 minutes after departure.
- VFR Class C Departures: Determine destination/direction of flight and make
note of requested altitude in flight strip. No initial altitude restrictions necessary
unless otherwise coordinated.
- Using RWY05/RWY23/RWY32: Traffic departing westbound or through DKK
DME shall be assigned to WR.
- Using RWY14: Traffic departing westbound or through DKK DME shall be
assigned to ER.
- RV to first fix

- E/S/W may be combined when the positions are not separately staffed by
another controller.
2. CAK_E_APP
- E/S combined. May use simplified CAK_APP callsign.
- W may be combined with E/S when the position is not separated staffed
by another controller.
3. MFD_APP

Other positions may only be opened during events or with the permission of the
ATM/DATM/TA/EC/CIC.

## Issue Clearances / Amendments / Instruction / SIDS

CD shall issue ATC clearances to IFR and VFR Class B departures as followed:
1. IFR Departures: Standard Instrument Departure Route (SID) should be utilized

SID”. If the aircraft is not filed on a SID, they shall be:
- Jet: cleared to maintain 6,000ft.
- Turboprop/Piston: cleared to maintain 4,000ft.

2. GTLKE SID usage:
- DAIFE transition for use for ORD departures only.
- BAGEL transition for use for MDW departures only.
- ALPHE/YABRO transition for use for any departure.

3. Local IFR: aircraft requesting a “local” IFR (destination airports within the CLE
terminal area) clearance shall be issued 4,000 feet and radar vectors to
destination airport.

4. VFR Class B Departures: determine destination/direction of flight, clear
aircraft “out” of CLE Class B, and maintain VFR at or below the following
altitudes:
If on-course heading is: Clear the aircraft at or below:
252 degrees clockwise to 058 degrees 2,500 feet
059 degrees clockwise to 251 degrees 3,000 feet

5. Departure Frequency Designation:
- Aircraft cleared via GTLKE#, PFLYD#, ZAAPA# and Non-SID departures shall
be assigned DN (D) as their departure frequency.
- Aircraft cleared via CAVVS# and KKIDS# shall be assigned DS (R) as their
departure frequency.
